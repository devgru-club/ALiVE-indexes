# ALiVE-Indexes


All donations for Map Indexing should be sent to $diveyez on CashApp

**Updating, Patching, and Reindexing Maps for ALiVE. Dear indexing participants. Please stop using illegal characters when designating pbo target. Please clean your cache of _\x\ code before attempting a spotcheck/bugfix. Do not post an index after mine, if you have not done the homework to triple check the arrays for sanity when finished!**

**Note, do not use workshop versions, make a copy in the base folder Arma 3/@modname**

## Usage

- Put the x folder in your Mission.Map folder before packing the mission as a PBO for usage with ALiVE.

### Disclaimer

-  These are preliminary Indexes and will be subject to change as needed by my Milsim Group's deployments continue to develop over time while testing and developing for the upcoming releases of the maps in 2020. Prior to pushing those releases, we felt it was necessary to fix the already existing indexes for some of these maps. This is still a work in progress, please do not publish any of these indexes to any sites, however we believe it is safe for you to pack the x\* folders into your mission.pbo's for usage when they are marked [x] Done.


#### When ALiVE indexes are finished, I will transfer the indexes to Github, and issue a pull request on the official ALiVE.os repository.


_Thank you for the encouragements, however I must postpone the release of the 2020 map pack. After speaking with Temppa and Nremik I have dediced to fix the already existing issues arising with ALiVE prior to the CoopR Mod release, and help ALiVE.os users sort some very troubling issues in the indexes existing in the official data files for ALiVE.os._
